                        <p>
                            In this part of our homeexam, I have decided to take the accesibility test through Google's very own Lighthouse. 
                            The reason for me to choose this testing tool is due to its well integrated with Google Chrome and OsloMet is also 
                            known for using this tool as well. My automated test has been tested carefully several times to ensure that accesibility was tested correctly
                            by taking the screenshot thorugh my MacBook-Air with the precise score. I made my accesibility-test by right click on the pad and inspect my webpage for
                            "Oceanlab". There I could see the "Lighthouse"-button and I firstly chose "Accessibility" and let it go through this page. 
                            My score for this test was 100 which can be seen on the screenshot that is provided on this side of the page while reading.

                            The overview of my design choices and coding is quite simple, but the simplest things are
                            often the hardest ones to create in my opinion. The color choices with dark grey enhances the depth of
                            the website and illustrates elegance in its minimalistic design. 
                            The main focus is on the images that is provided for every webpage, so 
                            the user can hover the mouse/pad on them to witness the texts emerging.

                         <!-- Heading and introductory text -->
                        <h2>Lighthouse Score and more in-depth design choices</h2>
                        <!-- Text -->
                        <p>
                            After the accesibility-test, I wanted to test everything on this website and I managed to get overall performance: 100. I was surprised, but that also made me believe that I am on the right track as well. 
                            This test was made with "Oceanlab" as you can see on the screenshoot. The main goal of the design is to make it the most user-friendly as possible. 
                            By user-friendly, I stuck with concept called "Less is More" and this pattern of layout can be seen all through my website. 
                            I have simplified the task to the extent that it will be obvious to know where to navigate through my minimalistic style. 
                            Most of my coding is something I have learned thorughout the years while I studied Industrial Design in the Netherlands, but also here as well. 
                            I have chosen to not provide screenshots of the coding since I believe it wont fit the webpage and it will be too much going on.
                            Anyways, my coding choices are structured and mostly used the same coding pattern for most of the sites.
                            Commonly, I have provided the same Nav-Bar to all of the pages, but the Logo on the right-side will change for each page you are on to indicate
                            more of which webpage you are on.
