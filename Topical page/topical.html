                        <h2>What is 'Technology and Society'?</h2>
                        <p>
                            We are living in a time when rapid technological developments are causing
                            profound changes at all levels of society. Each and every profession is
                            affected in some significant way, and because of this, the labour market’s
                            demand for digital competence is increasing. This course - ‘Technology and
                            Society’ - is developed to meet this demand.
                            In this course, you will get a general understanding of some of the most
                            influential tools and technologies of today. You will learn how to identify
                            the opportunities to use technology to develop good societies, as well as to
                            recognize the limitations and potentially harmful consequences on work and
                            society. Reflecting on the social, ethical, and moral issues that arise as
                            technology becomes increasingly complex and integrated with all parts of
                            society is an important part of the course.
                            By bringing together perspectives from different professions and schools of
                            thought, this course will explore the relationship between technology and
                            society from many different angles. We will encourage you to meet different
                            viewpoints with curiosity and to engage in discussions with students that
                            have different perspectives and different professional experiences than you.

                        <p>
                            Advance Ontarians’ privacy and access rights by working with public institutions
                            to develop bedrock principles and comprehensive governance frameworks for the

                            their digital literacy and the expansion of their digital rights while holding

                            and community-based approaches that protect both public safety and Ontarians’ access
                            and privacy rights.
                            Trust in Digital Health

                            the privacy and access rights of Ontarians and supporting the pioneering use of
                            personal health information for research and analytics to the extent it serves the
                            public good.
